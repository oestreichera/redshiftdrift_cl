## Redshift Drift $C_l$

Code to calculate the angular power spectrum of redshift drift fluctuations as described in [arxiv:2505.04731](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04731)

For either a $\Lambda$ CDM universe:

> cl.py

or an EinsteinDe-Sitter universe:

> cl_EdS.py 

### Requirements

The code requires the library [FFTLog-and-beyond](https://github.com/xfangcosmo/FFTLog-and-beyond)
and the python version of [CLASS](http://class-code.net/) which can be installed using

	pip install classy
